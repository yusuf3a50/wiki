### What free and open-source virtualization software is available on Linux?

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): KVM is a virtualization module in the Linux kernel that allows the kernel to function as a hypervisor. It supports running multiple virtual machines (VMs) with near-native performance. KVM is widely used and is integrated into many Linux distributions.

Xen Hypervisor - run by QubesOS

VirtualBox - developed by Oracle Corporation

QEMU

| **Virtualization Software** | **User Friendliness** | **Key Features** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Export/Import Ease** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| **[LXC](lxc.md)**                     | Moderate              | - Lightweight container-based virtualization<br>- Uses the host kernel | - Efficient resource usage<br>- Fastest startup times<br>- Good for microservices | - Less isolation than full VMs<br>- Limited to Linux-based systems | - Containers can be exported/imported easily using `lxc export` and `lxc import` commands, making it straightforward. |
| **KVM**                     | Moderate              | - Integrated into the Linux kernel<br>- Supports full virtualization<br>- High performance | - Near-native performance<br>- Strong community support<br>- Scalable | - Requires command-line knowledge<br>- Configuration can be complex | - VMs can be exported/imported using `virsh` commands or via `virt-manager`, but may require manual configuration of storage and network settings. |
| **QEMU**                    | Moderate              | - Emulates various hardware<br>- Can be used with KVM for performance<br>- Supports multiple architectures | - Highly flexible<br>- Good for testing and development<br>- Supports live migration | - Can be complex to set up<br>- Performance may vary without KVM | - Supports various image formats (e.g., QCOW2), making it easy to copy and move VM files, but may require additional steps for configuration. |
| **[VirtualBox](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-virtualbox-in-linux/)**              | High                  | - User-friendly GUI<br>- Supports multiple guest OS<br>- Snapshots and shared folders | - Easy to install and use<br>- Good for desktop virtualization<br>- Cross-platform support | - Performance may not match KVM/Xen<br>- Limited features in the open-source version<br><b>- USB support is slow | - Simple export/import process via the GUI (OVF/OVA format), making it user-friendly for moving VMs. |
| **[Xen](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_Project_Beginners_Guide)**                     | Moderate              | - Supports paravirtualization and full virtualization<br>- Strong isolation | - High performance<br>- Good for enterprise use<br>- Strong security features | - Very complex to set up and manage and poor documentation<br>- Requires specific hardware support | - Exporting/importing can be done using `xm` or `xl` commands, but may require manual adjustments to configuration files. |
| **OpenVZ**                  | Moderate              | - Container-based virtualization<br>- Resource management and isolation | - Efficient resource usage<br>- Easy to manage<br>- Good for hosting environments | - Limited to Linux guests<br>- Less flexibility compared to full virtualization | - Supports easy export/import of containers using `vzctl` commands, but limited to OpenVZ environments. |
| **Proxmox VE**              | High                  | - Combines KVM and LXC<br>- Web-based management interface<br>- Backup and restore features | - User-friendly interface<br>- Good for both VMs and containers<br>- Active community | - Requires a bit of learning for advanced features<br>- May need additional configuration for optimal performance | - Provides a straightforward backup/restore feature for VMs and containers, making export/import easy through the web interface. |
| **oVirt**                   | Moderate              | - Web-based management for KVM<br>- Supports live migration and high availability | - Enterprise-level features<br>- Good for managing large environments<br>- Strong community support | - Can be complex to set up<br>- Requires a dedicated management server | - Supports export/import of VMs via the web interface, but may require additional configuration for storage and networking. |
